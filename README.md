# **AI with Java & Kotlin** ðŸš€ðŸ¤–  

This repository is dedicated to implementing **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** using **Java and Kotlin**, avoiding Python-based ecosystems. The goal is to explore AI using **JVM-based tools and libraries**, ensuring performance, type safety, and interoperability with enterprise applications.



## **ðŸ“Œ Why Java/Kotlin for AI?**  

While Python dominates the AI field, Java and Kotlin offer:  

âœ… **Performance** â€“ Runs on the JVM with optimized JIT compilation.  
âœ… **Enterprise-ready** â€“ Easily integrates with existing Java applications.  
âœ… **Strong typing** â€“ Reduces runtime errors with type safety.  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ JVM-based solutions work well in production.
